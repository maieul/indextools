#What is it

This pack­age en­ables the user to pro­duce and type­set one or more in­dices si­mul­ta­ne­ously.
The pack­age is known to work in LATEX doc­u­ments pro­cessed with pdfLATEX, X∃LATEX and LuaLATEX. If makein­dex is used for pro­cess­ing the in­dex en­tries, no par­tic­u­lar setup is needed when TEX Live is used. Us­ing xindy or other pro­grams, it is nec­es­sary to en­able shell es­cape. Shell es­cape is also needed if splitin­dex is used.
This is a fork of imakeidx, with new fea­tures and fixed bugs.
